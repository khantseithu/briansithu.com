## Overview

This portfolio website showcases my projects, skills, and experiences. It is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework, Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, and Radix UI, a set of components and styles for building accessible and responsive user interfaces. With the integration of MDX, I can easily create blog posts using a combination of Markdown and React components.

- **Project Showcase**: A section to showcase my latest projects, including descriptions, images, and links.
- **Blog**: A blog section where I can write technical articles, tutorials, and share my thoughts.
- **Contact**: A page with contact information and a contact form to reach out to me.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be fully responsive and work across different devices.
- **Dark Mode**: A dark mode option for a better viewing experience during the night.
